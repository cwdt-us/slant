# Benchmarks

To analyze the speed of our VADER implementation vs. the canonical one, simply run 
`python vader_benchmark.py`

To benchmark *slant* in a consistent environment, we include a speed test in our Colaboratory
Notebook and consistently see *slant* perform sentiment analysis 80x faster than the canonical VADER
implementation.
