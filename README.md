# slant
`slant` enables researchers to both reliably and
efficiently assess the degree to which texts generated by GPT-2, other tools, or through manual
production contain bias. The governing concern here is that researchers not produce texts for
research that contain biases against individuals portrayed in them according to race/ethnicity,
gender, sexual and religious orientation, or political affiliation and ideology.

`slant` was designed to be used by researchers who create and implement text-based survey
experiments, particularly those that rely on vignettes. We expect that it will be particularly
useful to researchers doing work in substantive areas where the bias contained in manually or
automatically generated texts might be most problematic, such as in race and ethnic politics.

## Installation
```bash
python3 -m pip install slant
```

## Usage
